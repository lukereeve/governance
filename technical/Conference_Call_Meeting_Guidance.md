### Conference Call Meeting Guidance 

How to run a meeting:

* Use the [meeting template](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/governance/wiki/Web-Conference,-YYYY.MM.DD-(Convening-Group-Name)) off the wiki to create a new meeting agenda.
* The OMF public calendar is where the meetings are published. Verify the meeting information there is correct. If not contact 
* Publish the meeting agenda to the [MDS Announce List](https://groups.google.com/a/groups.openmobilityfoundation.org/forum/#!forum/mds-announce) at least two days before the meeting.
* At the start of the meeting, ask attendees to rename themselves to put their organization after their full name.
* Share the link to the wiki agenda in the chat, and ask the attendees to add their names.
* Ask for one person to takes notes. 
* After the meeting, the chair and note taker finalizes the notes on the wiki page. Include links to any presentations or documents or a recording.
* If there are relevant action items for chair or any attendee, add those to the appropriate Issue or PR as a new comment.
