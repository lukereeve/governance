# Working Group Management 

How to run the working group day to day:

* The release announcements and process schedule will be communicated via [mds-announce](https://groups.google.com/a/groups.openmobilityfoundation.org/forum/#!forum/mds-announce) by the chair.
* [Meeting agendas](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/governance/blob/master/technical/Conference_Call_Meeting_Guidance.md) will be communiticated via [mds-announce](https://groups.google.com/a/groups.openmobilityfoundation.org/forum/#!forum/mds-announce) by the chair at least two days prior.
* Deliverables from a WG are developed by its Contributors and the WGSC.
* Maintainers review and approve contributions.
* Contributors fork the repository, and make their PR on the OMF repository.
* Chairs and maintainers triage the backlog of issues and PRs.
* Pull requests and release notes should include a summary of the major changes / impacts associated with the change or release.
* Proposed changes should come in the form of PRs to give the community ample awareness and time for feedback.

## Daily triage issues PRs for labels milestones

* Review the project backlog for unassigned issues and PRs.
* It should be obvious in most cases which API and change type the item should be assigned.
* Allow the working group chairs to assign items to a milestone.

## Labels, milestones (for issues, PRs)

* WGSC members should update the labels and milestones for their issues and pull requests at least weekly.
