# Working Group Management 

How to run the working group day to day:

* Chairs create meeting agendas on the [Wiki](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/wiki) and add link to WG pages.
* Run WG meetings and add notes to meeting Wiki pages and on appropriate Github Issues/PRs.
* The release announcements and process schedule will be communicated to WG forum by the chair.
* [Meeting agendas](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/governance/blob/master/technical/Conference_Call_Meeting_Guidance.md) will be communicated to the WG forum and [mds-announce](https://groups.google.com/a/groups.openmobilityfoundation.org/forum/#!forum/mds-announce) by the chair at least two days prior.
* Deliverables from a WG are developed by its Contributors and the WGSC.
* Maintainers review and approve contributions.
* Contributors fork the repository, and make their PR on the OMF repository.
* Chairs and maintainers triage the backlog of issues and PRs.
* Pull requests and release notes should include a summary of the major changes / impacts associated with the change or release.
* Proposed changes should come in the form of PRs to give the community ample awareness and time for feedback.

## Issue and PR Triage

* WGSC members should update the labels and milestones for their issues and pull requests at least weekly.
* Review the project backlog for unassigned issues and PRs.
* Allow the working group chairs to assign items to a milestone.
* Leave comments on issues/PR based on meeting discussions and decisions made.
